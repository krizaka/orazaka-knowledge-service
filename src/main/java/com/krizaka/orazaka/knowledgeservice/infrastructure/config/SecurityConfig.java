/**
 * Stateless security for the knowledge service.
 *
 * <p>The session JWT is verified locally against the shared HS256 secret and its {@code roles}
 * claim becomes the authorities — the identity service already signs them in, so a retrieval never
 * pays an identity hop.
 *
 * <p>URL rules stay coarse (authenticated vs not) on purpose: per-resource access is a method
 * concern expressed with {@code @PreAuthorize} on the controllers, not a class-name or a URL
 * convention (ERR-128). The one structural rule is {@code /internal/v1/**}, which separates the
 * machine-to-machine surface from the human one — a retrieval performed for a chat turn is
 * requested by the core on the actor's behalf, not by a browser holding a session.
 *
 * <p>This service had no security at all until ADR-035's follow-up: no starter on the classpath, no
 * chain, and therefore nothing for the {@code permitAll} rule to catch — its RAG surface was
 * reachable with no credential and no line of configuration said so.
